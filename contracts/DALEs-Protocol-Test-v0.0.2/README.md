# DALEs Protocol

## Multi-chain DALEs Infrastructure Service Protocol




- ## Project Q&A




### 1„ÄÅWhat is the DALEs Protocol? 


DALEs Protocol is developed under the authorization of the EVIRE, focusing on the creation of web3 basic component. DALEs Protocol belongs to a multi-chain infrastructure service protocol.  Anyone can create and manage their own DALEs organization through DALEs Protocol, including trust DALEs, corporation DALEs and foundation DALEs. Any DALE can also create a management department within the DALE to achieve multi-level management of the organization.



### 2„ÄÅWhat is the EVIREÔºü

EVIRE is a beacon for the future of digital innovation, rooted in the principles of anonymity and collective progress. Our mission is to harness the transformative power of Web3 to create a future where technology empowers freedom, privacy, and collaboration. We are dedicated to building the foundational blocks of tomorrow's digital landscape, focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Real-World Assets (RWA), Decentralized Personal Information Networks (DePIN), and Decentralized Science (DeSCI).

üîç Our Belief: We stand firm in the belief that anonymity is not just a feature but a fundamental right. It safeguards freedom and encourages diverse voices to contribute towards common objectives without the constraints of bias or prejudice. In this spirit, we are committed to creating an ecosystem where contributors can work harmoniously, driven by well-designed incentives, to pioneer the building blocks of tomorrow's technology.

üöÄ Our Focus: Our efforts are channeled into:

Artificial Intelligence (AI): We are pushing the boundaries of AI to ensure it serves as a force for good, enhancing privacy and security while fostering the development of decentralized intelligence. Our initiatives aim to make AI systems more transparent, ethical, and accessible, contributing to a future where technology augments human potential without compromising individual rights.

Real-World Assets (RWA): Our work with RWAs is about bridging the gap between physical assets and the digital world, enabling the tokenization and decentralized management of real-world resources. This initiative promises to revolutionize ownership, investment, and the very nature of economic activities, making them more inclusive, efficient, and transparent.

Decentralized Personal Information Networks (DePIN): We are at the forefront of developing DePIN to protect personal information in the digital age. Our goal is to create robust networks that ensure complete control and privacy of personal data, enabling individuals to share and manage their information on their terms, free from unauthorized surveillance and exploitation.

Decentralized Science (DeSCI): Our commitment to DeSCI aims to transform how scientific research is conducted, funded, and published. By leveraging decentralized technologies, we are working to create an open, transparent, and collaborative scientific ecosystem that accelerates innovation, enhances reproducibility, and ensures that knowledge is freely accessible to all.


### 3„ÄÅJoin Us in Shaping the Future:


We invite visionaries, innovators, and advocates for privacy and decentralization to join us in our quest to shape a future where technology reflects our values and serves the collective good. Whether you are passionate about AI, interested in the potential of RWAs, eager to contribute to DePIN, or excited about revolutionizing science through DeSCI, there is a place for you in our community.
